# Examples

This directory holds example programs:

*  [producer-consumer-queue](producer-consumer-queue/README.md) shows how
   multiple consumers (in threads) fetch items from a queue, while concurrent
   consumers never pick up the same work item.

*  [top-2000-songs-2016-in-NL/](top-2000-songs-2016-in-NL/README.md) is a
   general example, in this case it loads the top 2000 tracks of all times as
   voted in the Netherlands in the year 2016 and performs a simple analysis.
